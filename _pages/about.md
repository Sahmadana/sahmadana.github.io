I am a doctoral candidate at the Freie Universität Berlin and currently work as a research fellow with the research group ‘Globalization, Work, and Production’ at the Berlin Social Science Center. My interdisciplinary research project looks at the global content moderation value chains and the role of Indian IT-BPO firms in servicing social media platforms located in the Global North. While, I primarily study the managerial strategies of labor control for extracting labor productivity, and the accompanying forms of agency exercised by content moderators in India, I also link them to the affordances of social media platforms and user activities. I find it both interesting and important to connect these two intersecting layers of platform operations through the focus on content moderation.

In addition to academic work, I occassionally write journalistic articles on national politics and labour relations in India and in Europe. More information can be found on the publication page.

Prior to academia, I worked in the field of digital campaigning with civil society organisations in India and in the UK. More information can be found on the CV page.

My research interests include data/ ML studies, critical internet studies, intersectionality, labor sociology, industrial relations, and supply chains.
