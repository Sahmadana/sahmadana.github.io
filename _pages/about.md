I am a doctoral candidate at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin and currently work as a research fellow with Globalization, Work, and Production group at WZB Berlin Social Science Center. Currently in the final stages, my interdisciplinary research project examines global content moderation value chains and the role of Indian IT-BPO firms in servicing social media platforms located in the Global North. Using primarily a production point of view, I show that while content moderation work is highly controlled and standardized, it cannot be automated due to the indeterminate character of social media platforms. From this perspective, this is a tale of polarization of workers, with much of the moderation work being done by low-paid workers in India but also by migrant workers in Germany, as shown in a paper I co-authored. The implications of this for the public discourse need to be seen in the highly controlled manner in which current content moderation apparatus functions, leaving little room for both users and workers to exercise discretion. 

In addition to academic work, I occassionally write journalistic articles on national politics and labor relations in India and in Europe. More information can be found on the publication page.

Prior to academia, I worked in the field of digital campaigning with civil society organisations in India and in the UK. More information can be found on the CV page.

My research interests include data/ ML studies, critical internet studies, intersectionality, migrant work, labor process, industrial relations, and supply chains.
