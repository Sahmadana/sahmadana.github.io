I am a doctoral candidate at the Freie Universität Berlin and currently work as a research fellow with the research group ‘Globalization, Work, and Production’ at the Berlin Social Science Center. My interdisciplinary research project looks at the global content moderation value chains and the role of Indian IT-BPO firms in servicing social media platforms located in the Global North. While, I primarily study the managerial strategies of labour control for extracting labour productivity, and the accompanying forms of agency exercised by content moderators in India, I also link them to the affordances of social media platforms and user activities. I find it both interesting and important to connect these two sides of platform operations through the focus on content moderation.

In addition to academic work, I occassionally write journalistic articles on national politics and labour relations in India and in Europe. Please check out some of this work together with the academic writing in the publication section of this website.

Prior to academia, I worked in the field of digital campaigning with civil society organisations in India and in the UK. You can find more details on my educational qualifications and work experiences in my CV.

My research interests include data/ ML studies, critical internet studies, intersectionality, labor sociology, industrial relations, and supply chains.
