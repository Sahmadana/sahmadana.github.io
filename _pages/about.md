I am a researcher interested in all things related to work and workers, but with special interest in the processes of digitalisation and automation. I wrote my PhD dissertation on content moderation value chains in India by focusing on the power assymetries between global tech firms and Indian subcontractors, the role of state policies in facilitating this relationship, and how these macro mechanisms structure the workplace dynamics of labor control and resistance. During this time, I was also affiliated as a research fellow with the WZB Berlin Social Science Center and the Weizenbaum Institute. 

Currently, I am employed as a researcher at the Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg, and affiliated as a guest researcher at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. My current projects include writing a book on content moderation work in India, together with working on a project on migrants and crowdwork in Germany. This project is aimed at examining the motivations and career trajectories of migrant workers underatking microtasks on crowdworking platforms. Additionally, I am working on a postdoctoral proposal on studying processes of workplace automation from a global economy perspective.

Apart from these projects, I co-host an intersectional feminist podcast called Purple Code together with my former colleagues at the Weizenbaum Institute. Given the lack of female and queer voices on digital technologies, we started this podcast to create a community of academics, activits, journalists, artists and others and learn from their experiencies.
