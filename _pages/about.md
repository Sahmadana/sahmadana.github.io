I am a researcher interested in content moderation and labour relations. My doctoral project looks at the global content moderation value chains and the role of Indian IT-BPO firms in servicing social media platforms located in the Global North. In doing so, I primarily study the managerial strategies of labour control and the accompanying forms of agency exercised by Indian content moderators. 

 I am a doctoral candidate at the Freie Universität Berlin and currently work with the research groups ‘Work in Highly Automated, Digital-Hybrid Processes’ at the Weizenbaum Institute in Berlin, and the "Globalization, Work, and Production" unit at the Berlin Social Science Center.

 Prior to academia, I have worked in the field of digital campaigning with civil society organisations in India and in the UK. You can find more about my work experience in the CV section of this website.
