I recently (March, 2023) submitted my doctoral dissertation at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin and currently work as a research fellow with Globalization, Work, and Production group at WZB Berlin Social Science Center. My interdisciplinary research project examined global content moderation value chains and the role of Indian IT-BPO firms in servicing social media platforms located in the Global North. Using primarily a production point of view, I showed that while content moderation work is highly controlled and standardized, it cannot be automated due to the indeterminate character of social media platforms. Workers and their agency remain significant for ensuring the scale, time and nuances of content moderation. This research, while contributing to the media and communications scholarship on content governance strategies on social media platforms, also provides useful links to understanding the competitive dynamics in data and IT-Services value chains. 

I am currently in the process of converting my PhD monograph into a book, and looking for research opportunities either through an independent post-doc project or collaboration with teams in and outside of Germany. My future research interests include data/ ML studies, platform/ service economy, value/ supply chains, labor process automation, and the use of intersectional perspectives in work and employment studies.
