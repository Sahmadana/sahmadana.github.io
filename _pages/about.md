I am a doctoral candidate at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin and currently work as a research fellow with Globalization, Work, and Production group at WZB Berlin Social Science Center. Currently in the final stages, my interdisciplinary research project examines global content moderation value chains and the role of Indian IT-BPO firms in servicing social media platforms located in the Global North. Using primarily a production point of view, I show that while content moderation work is highly controlled and standardized, it cannot be automated due to the indeterminate character of social media platforms. Workers and their agency remain significant for ensuring the scale, time and nuances of content moderation.

In addition to academic work, I occassionally write journalistic articles on national politics and labor relations in India and in Europe. More information can be found on the publication page.

Prior to academia, I worked in the field of digital campaigning with civil society organisations in India and in the UK. More information can be found on the CV page.

My research interests include data/ ML studies, critical internet studies, intersectionality, migrant work, labor process, industrial relations, and supply chains.
