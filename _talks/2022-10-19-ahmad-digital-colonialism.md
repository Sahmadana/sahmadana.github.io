Together with Bianca Herlo and Lena Ulbricht, this workshop looked at the question of how digital technologies are related to contemporary colonialism? We will collectively explore this question in the workshop, drawing from the participants’ and workshop leaders’ experiences and expertise. The main aim is to make visible the complex and often hidden colonial structures in digitalised societies. Colonialism is a variety of forms of structural domination of the global South by the global North. Digitalised societies are enmeshed with colonial structures through various mechanisms and areas: digital markets, working conditions, extractivism, electronic waste, energy consumption, data protection violations, manipulation, discrimination and oppression, among other issues. The workshop explores this variety and systematises it. It also focuses on different cases of resistance against colonialism in the Digital Age. The latter are manifold and creative but heavily struggling with strong colonial, capitalist logic. The pedagogical approach is to work in small groups, interactive, and case-based.
